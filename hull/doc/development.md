# Development Notes

## Adding a new Kubernetes object type (Example: PriorityClass)

### Check which object template is right for the type to implement:
- `_objects_base_plain.tpl`: simple object without array structures that should be converted to dictionaries
- `_objects_base_rbac.tpl`: simple object without array structures that should be converted to dictionaries and subject to RBAC enablement
- `_objects_base_spec.tpl`: simple object without array structures that should be converted to dictionaries having a `spec` property
- `_objects_base_pod.tpl`: objects that internally use a pod template 
- `_objects_xyz.tpl`: any other more complex object with array structures that should be converted to dictionaries requires a custom template

[PriorityClass](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.20/#priorityclass-v1-scheduling-k8s-io) is a very simple structure so it can use `_objects_base_plain.tpl`

### Add to the handled objects in `hull.yaml`

```yaml
{{- /*
### Load plain objects
*/ -}}
{{- $template := "hull.object.base.plain" }}
{{- $allObjects = merge $allObjects (dict "ServiceAccount" (dict "HULL_TEMPLATE" $template)) }}
{{- $allObjects = merge $allObjects (dict "StorageClass" (dict "HULL_TEMPLATE" $template "API_VERSION" "storage.k8s.io/v1")) }}
{{- $allObjects = merge $allObjects (dict "CustomResource" (dict "HULL_TEMPLATE" $template)) }}
{{- $allObjects = merge $allObjects (dict "PriorityClass" (dict "HULL_TEMPLATE" $template "API_VERSION" "scheduling.k8s.io/v1")) }}
```

### Add the defaults to `values.yaml`

```yaml
...

###################################################

# PODDISRUPTIONBUDGET
poddisruptionbudget :
    _HULL_OBJECT_TYPE_DEFAULT_:
    enabled: true
    annotations: {}
    labels: {}
###################################################

# PRIORITYCLASS
priorityclass :
    _HULL_OBJECT_TYPE_DEFAULT_:
    enabled: true
    annotations: {}
    labels: {}
###################################################
```

### Add the required information to the `values.schema.json`

- add root schema element (`priorityclass`)
- add referenced schema element from root schema element (`priorityclass.v1`)
- any K8S schema element that should be combined with HULL schema elements (eg. `#/definitions/hull.ObjectBase.v1`) needs to be prepared for this:
- remove the `additionalProperties: false` attribute so schema checking can handle coexistence of multiple schemas
- add a `.Names` schema element to list the allowed property names
- if referenced K8S schema element is a 'root' object remove the properties `apiVersion`, `kind` and `metadata` since the are handled by `#/definitions/hull.ObjectBase.v1`

### Add tests for object type

- Create folder at `files/test/HULL/sources/cases` for object type (eg. `files/test/HULL/sources/priorityclass`)
- add `hull.values.yaml` with test cases
- write the test spec at `files/test/HULL/specs` (eg. `files/test/HULL/specs/priorityclass,spec`) and define tests

### Add documentation to the `README.md`

- add to the available object types and if needed add further documentation.

## Creating a release branch for a new Kubernetes version

### Create branch

Branch must be named `release-1.x` where x is the minor version of the Kubernetes release. Switch to this branch.

### Create JSON schema 

Create a new matching JSON schema in the `kubernetes-json-schema` folder with the instructions given in the [README.md](./../../kubernetes-json-schema/README.md) there. Patch version can be the highest available. It is expected no object properties are changed between patch versions.

### Adapt the JSON schema

Copy the `_definition.json` from the newly created schema folder to `values.schema.json` in the `hull` charts root library overwriting the existing content. Compare the `values.schema.json` content with that of the previous release version branch and adapt as need (the complicated part). Consider copying the changes related to the objects that HULL deals with and leave other API changes alone.

### Adapt `Chart.yaml`

Set the versions in `Chart.yaml`:

- `version: 1.x.1` where x is the Kubernetes major version
- `appVersion: 1.x.y` where x is the Kubernetes major version and y the patch version of the schema
- `kubeVersion: ">= 1.x.0"` where x is the Kubernetes major version

### Adapt test chart
Set the versions in `Chart.yaml` of the test chart at `hull/files/test/HULL/sources/charts/hull-test`:

- `version: 1.x.1` where x is the Kubernetes major version
- `appVersion: 1.x.y` where x is the Kubernetes major version and y the patch version of the schema
- `kubeVersion: ">= 1.x.0"` where x is the Kubernetes major version
- ```yaml
  dependencies:
  - name: hull
    version: "1.x.1"
    repository: "https://vidispine.github.io/hull"
    ```
     where x is the Kubernetes major version 

### Adapt test schema

Replace the files for the Kubernetes JSON schema in `hull/files/test/HULL/schema` with the created files from the new subfolder of `kubernetes-json-schema`. This makes the JSON validation test against the new version.

### Adapt tests

in the `specs/concepts/metadata_basic.cpt` change the version that is tested against:

- `* All test objects have key "metadata§labels§app.kubernetes.io/version" with value "1.x.y"` where x is the Kubernetes major version and y the patch version of the schema

### Run tests

All tests need to run successfully.

## Creating a new minor version

### Adapt the JSON schema (if needed)

Make the changes required for the version update.

### Adapt `Chart.yaml`

Set the versions in `Chart.yaml`:

- `version: 1.x.z` where x is the Kubernetes major version and z the increased minor version

### Adapt test chart
Set the versions in `Chart.yaml` of the test chart at `hull/files/test/HULL/sources/charts/hull-test`:

- `version: 1.x.z` where x is the Kubernetes major version and z the increased minor version
- ```yaml
  dependencies:
  - name: hull
    version: "1.x.z"
    repository: "https://vidispine.github.io/hull"
  ```
  where x is the Kubernetes major version and z the increased minor version

### Adapt tests

Add or modify test cases so that the new changes are covered adequately.

### Run tests

All tests need to run successfully to create a new release.
