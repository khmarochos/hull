[1.26.6]
------------------
FIXES:
- extend loosening of schema type to env fields. User input of type float, integer or boolean is now allowed and on rendering a late to string conversion is taking place to guarantee the Kubernetes schema is not violated demanding string values. 

------------------
[1.26.5]
------------------
FIXES:
- loosen schema types of image tag, annotation and label values. For image tag values user input of type float or integer and for annotation and label values user input of type float, integer and boolean is allowed. On rendering a late to string conversion is taking place to guarantee the Kubernetes schema is not violated demanding string values. Reasoning behind is that for these fields correct quoting of user input is often missing in case of values which are interpreted as non-strings. Allowing a flexible input type and late guaranteed conversion to string helps avoid unncessary and unexpected errors due to user input.
- drop kubeVersion from Chart.yaml to support running hull-demo in lower version clusters, kubeVersion field does not seem to have relevance for hull as a library chart but is copied over to hull-demo Chart.yaml

------------------
[1.26.4]
------------------
CHANGES:
- allow to use implicitly set OBJECT_INSTANCE_KEY and OBJECT_TYPE context variables for accessing an object instance's key and type as strings in the context of transformations executed within an object instance's specification.

------------------
[1.26.3]
------------------
CHANGES:
- allow to set an explicit namespaceOverride via chart configuration on the object instances rendered. This is helpful for usage with helm template command so that rendered templates contain a namespace and can be used directly in GitOps style declarative workflows. If no namespaceOverride is provided, the namespace is now still always added to the object instances and falls back to the release namespace.

------------------
[1.26.2]
------------------
CHANGES:
- by adding property hashsumAnnotation: true to a pods volumeMount, env or envFrom referencing a ConfigMap or Secret, a pod restart can be enforced in case of changed contents. This works by calculation of a hashsum of the contents and adding it to the pods template annotations. This is recommended practice as documented in the [Helm documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/howto/charts_tips_and_tricks/#automatically-roll-deployments) in order to handle applications that require restarts on certain configuration changes.

------------------
[1.26.1]
------------------
CHANGES:
- add metadataNameOverride possibility to Hull.Object.Base to allow setting an object instance metadata.name that is different from the implicit component key. This enables special use-cases where e.g. the definition of a custom resource instance is done in the chart's values.yaml under a fixed key and the CustomResources actual instance name - maybe playing an important role for the operator functionality - is only set at deployment time dynamically

------------------
[1.26.0]
------------------
CHANGES:
- initial K8S 1.26 release
- deprecating 1.23 release
- build and release hull-demo chart for easy demoing and bootstrapping HULL based Helm Charts

FIXES:
- improved schema structure for centrally defined probe configurations ([PR](https://github.com/vidispine/hull/pull/202), thanks [matthias4217](https://github.com/matthias4217))
- fix merging order for tests with additional overlay values.yamls

------------------
[1.25.10]
------------------
FIXES:
- when a dictionary structure contains a _HULL_TRANSFORMATION_ key for producing dynamically rendered key-value content and additional static keys side-by-side, transformations were not being correctly processed for the structures beneath the static key contents
- some minor documentation fixes (links in main README.md, broken structures)

------------------
[1.25.9]
------------------
FIXES:
- fixed incorrect schema structure for imagePullPolicy enums (thanks [matthias4217](https://github.com/matthias4217))

------------------
[1.25.8]
------------------
FIXES:
- fixed general linter error due to bad whitespace chomping between YAML objects, this did not affect template rendering however (https://github.com/vidispine/hull/issues/186)
- added strict linting to test cases, now all cases must not emit linting WARNINGs or ERRORs to be considered successful

------------------
[1.25.7]
------------------
FIXES:
- extend transformation scope from objects spec to Values.hull when computing initial transformations, fixes cases with first transformation resolving to another transformation which is then not resolved itself
- speed up rendering by only run transformations once on complete Values.hull dictionary instead of running it once for each object type

------------------
[1.25.6]
------------------
FIXES:
- render emtpy string instead of <nil> when ConfigMap or Secret inline input is nil pointer

CHANGES:
- add debug option renderNilWhenInlineIsNil to print out <nil> instead of empty string when an inline value resolves to a nil pointer
- add debug option renderPathMissingWhenPathIsNonExistent to print out information about a missing file for a path value instead of an empty string when a path value does not resolve to an actual file

------------------
[1.25.5]
------------------
CHANGES:
- changed transformation notation for include for better readability

FIXES:
- fixed and improve include transformation

------------------
[1.25.4]
------------------
CHANGES:
- add new include transformation and short form to allow compact usage of includes with minimum typing in values.yaml. 

FIXES:
- quote versions in Chart.yaml (https://github.com/vidispine/hull/issues/169)

------------------
[1.25.3]
------------------
CHANGES:
- for ConfigMap and Secret data, inline specification now always has precedence over path specification to make sure that content can always be overwritten at configuration time if required
- add active property to allow selecting amongst multiple volume definitions if they exist, eg. if a volume is defaulting to an emptyDir and is to be made a persistentVolumeClaim, the value of the active property (if specified) declares the concrete volume to render, otherwise Kubernetes will not accept multiple volume type definitions for a volume.

------------------
[1.25.2]
------------------
CHANGES:
- remove required property for endpoints and selector in ServiceMonitors from schema to allow better defaulting

------------------
[1.25.1]
------------------
CHANGES:
- add debug option renderBrokenHullGetTransformationReferences which allows to render HULL charts containing broken Get transformation references with non existing keys. By rendering these transformations with an informative placeholder instead of failing the chart rendering the broken references can be traced and fixed more easily before finishing writing the chart
- allows to use placeholder ยง to escape dots within key names so GET references also work when dots are within key names

------------------
[1.25.0]
------------------
CHANGES:
- initial K8S 1.25 release
- deprecating 1.22 release

CHANGES:
- added transformation pattern to array fields from ServiceMonitor definition
- update documentation

FIXES:
- HULL rules must be dictionary for roles in values.yaml

------------------
[1.23.2]
------------------
CHANGES:
- get transformation can now return complex dictionaries and array types
- introduce selector transformation and _HT& shortcut

FIXES:
- use fixed name template lower-case 'release-name' for helm template command compatibility with Helm 3.8. Previous versions created upper case 'RELEASE-NAME' by default for Release.Name which is changed to lowercase 'release-name' with Helm 3.8

------------------
[1.23.1]
------------------
CHANGES:
- allow to choose between rendering to single file or multiple files per object type to potentially eliminate performance penalty due to having one file only
- add test environments for both single and multi file usage
- add two example values.yamls

FIXES:
- allow using 63 instead of 54 chars for a fullname and name override
- remove dots end of labels and names

------------------
[1.23.0]
------------------
CHANGES:
- initial K8S 1.23 release
- deprecating 1.20 release

------------------
[1.22.13]
------------------
FIXES:
- changed probe port schema to anyOf to avoid clash when using oneOf transformation or string

------------------
[1.22.12]
------------------
FIXES:
- allow mixed transform only when dictionary is returned from transformation and other keys exist besides transformation trigger

------------------
[1.22.11]
------------------
CHANGES:
- added tests for get transformation results
- make every object field subjectable to string transformations irrelevant of input type by large scale extension of JSON schema

FIXES:
- using a get transformation to poulate Configmap/Secret contents produced bad 
character sequences

------------------
[1.22.10]
------------------
CHANGES:
- added short forms for transformations
- documentation improved

------------------
[1.22.9]
------------------
CHANGES:
- fix enabled properties allowed on policyrules in roles, envfrom and tls in ingresses
- allow shorter form of (index . "$") to access parent context

------------------
[1.22.8]
------------------

CHANGES:
- add hull.util.transformation.bool transformation

- BREAKING! change fields for registry population to overwrite any explicit registry fields 

------------------
[1.22.7]
------------------

CHANGES:
- add CHANGELOG.md
- add ingressclass objects as main objects
- allow to specify rules in roles key-value based instead of as an array (array also supported)
- add unit tests for ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBindings

FIXES: 
- clusterrole and clusterrolebinding objects with enabled=false or nulled were rendering incorrectly as empty objects 
- cronjob pods must not have selector set

------------------
[1.22.6]
------------------
CHANGES: 
- allow enabled property on all key-value pair HULL objects
- allow to use string as input for enabled property in order to use HULL transformations on enabled properties
